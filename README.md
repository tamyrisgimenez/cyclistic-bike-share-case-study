# Cyclistic Bike-Share Case Study
*How does a bike-share navigate speedy success?*

## Introduction
This capstone is part of the eighth and final course from the **Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate**. The two available case studies are Cyclistic Bike-Share and Bellabeat. I picked the latter and learned so much from working on it that I thought it would be a good idea to keep going and challenge myself to complete the second case study as well. In this project, like in the last one, I applied the five steps of the data analysis process taught in the program: **Ask**, **Prepare**, **Process**, **Analyze**, **Share**, and **Act** – while using Python to clean, analyze and visualize the data.

## Scenario
You are a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, your team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, your team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve your recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.

## Tools
